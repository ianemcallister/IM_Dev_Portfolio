And the source code for the project can be found here.

## Stack / Technologies
I wanted to demonstrate my proficiencies with a handful of technolgies so have chosen to expand the scope of this exercise.

* __GitHub__
    * _Primary repository for the source code._
* __Google Cloud Platform (GCP)__
    * _Free web hosting (up to a certain traffic level and if you understand containarization)._
* __Docker__
    * _Turns a code base into a provisioned container._
* __Google Cloud Run__
    * _Provisioning of the container._
* __Google Cloud Build__
    * _Used to convert a github repo of source code into a live web server, via a cloudbuild.yaml file._
* __Node.js__
    * _Server side javascript._
* __Express__
    * _Node based web server package._
* __NPM__
    * _Node Package Manager._
* __Typescript__
    * _Typing framework for javascript to encourage the development of more scaleable code._
* __CI/CD Pipeline__
    * _Cloud run makes setting up a continus integration and continous development pipline possible, so that each time code is pushed to the target repo a build of the source code is triggered and the container is rebuilt._

### DNS Registration
While the DNS has been mapped from squarespace domains to google cloud run at the time of this writing verification was still pending.
